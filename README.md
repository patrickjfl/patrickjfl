### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Patrick

I am a former teacher and trade union organiser turned full stack developer, after completing the [School of Code's](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) 16-week bootcamp.  With extensive experience working in a range of interpersonal settings, I have strong skills in communication, presentation and team-building, and over the course of the bootcamp I was able to develop and refine these skills to work within agile tech teams.  I also learnt a mind-bending amount about tech, going from creating basic "Hello, world!" programmes in week one to build full stack, interactive web applications, using Javascript, React, Node JS, Docker and AWS (among other tools) along the way.

I came to tech because I'm passionate about problem solving.  Both the nerdy, Code Wars type, and the big stuff.  I want to work on projects that solve problems in the world, big or small.
